Save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP):
	Con:
		Not secure, the file system can be accessed more easily than the app's memory.
		Also not secure because we'll be using the same credentials forever, by that time someone might figure out what it is.
	Pro:
		Less traffic from the phone and quicker than asking a server (see the con of the other option). This also means that the server would need to handle many more requests, linear to the amount of users.

Use this token only in this current app-launch, and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again:
	Con:
		More traffic that is needed. If the procedure to get the token is complicated, then it must be repeated again on each launch.
	Pro:
		Secure. It's harder to access an app's memory; and also in order to steal the token, a perpetrator would have to do his magic *every* time the app launches.
